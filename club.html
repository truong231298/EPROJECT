            <h3>National Team Training - The Climbing Diaries </h3>
            <p>

                It was terrifying, but I did get to the top. I didn’t care that it was the easiest route in the gym… It
                was the best feeling ever.

                In that moment, the only thing I wanted to know was, how can I do this as much as possible?

                The one time a week I could go was so precious to me. The whole week I would look forward to when I
                could climb.

                And when they gave me a key to the gym 6 months later, that was it. I lived for the gym. Not to mention,
                I basically lived in the gym.</p>

                    <p>While not as zany as some of the others on this list, Nanga Parbat’s status as the world’s
                        fastest-growing mountain seems worth a mention. As of 2005, the 8,126-meter (26,660ft) peak is
                        reportedly growing at a rate of 0.27 inches per year, which puts it on track to outstrip Everest
                        as the world’s tallest peak in around 241,000 years. This isn’t particularly exciting, although
                        it does mean that in a quarter of a million years all the Everest record-holding goons may have
                        their titles nixed</p>

                    <p>Brazilian woman Karina Oliani pulled herself 329 feet over a lava-filled crater in Ethiopia,
                        wearing what looks like an astronaut suit, in December 2017. “The most challenging part of this
                        record,” she said, “was finding two good rigging spots.” Tyroleans don’t really require any
                        particular skill or fitness level, so was this something any of us could do? Probably. But this
                        scene looks plucked straight out of a Metal Gear game, so I figured it was worth a mention.</p>

                        between April and May of 2019, collecting a whopping 22,879 pounds of garbage, as well as four
