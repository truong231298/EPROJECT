                    <h3>Marylebone Mountaineering & Climbing Club </h3>
                    <p>The Marylebone Mountaineering Club was founded in 1974 and boasts around 100 members who live
                        mostly in
                        and around London.

                        The activities of the club are centred around the once monthly meets which take place all over
                        the UK.
                        Many informal trips are also organised outside of the meet program with foreign trips, typically
                        to the
                        Alps or sport climbing in Spain and Italy. </p>
                    <p>As with other clubs there are various excursions to the London climbing walls and a large group
                        go to The
                        Castle on regular basis.

                        Membership is Â£18 a year and is open to anyone over 18. The club is affiliated to the BMC, and
                        members
                        will receive the same benefits as individual members of the BMC (third party insurance, free
                        Summit
                        magazine, reduced subscription rates to High magazine)</p>

                    <p>Their trips away schedule seems less formal than the other London Climbing Clubs in this section
                        but

                    <h3>The 8th Day Adventure Club </h3>
                    <p>I know we've said this before but The 8th Day really is one of the most active clubs in London.
                        The club covers many more activities than just climbing, ranging from mountain biking to dragon
                        boating and a whole heap in-between.
                        Whilst not a specific climbing club, they do have a group of climbers who meet at Mile End wall
                        every Monday and visit the other walls sporadically. As Mile End has a lot of bouldering
                        complete beginners are welcome to go and get stuck in to see if they like it. </p>
                    <p> The club also arranges the occasional outdoor climbing session around the UK and beyond and
                        members also often take their kit on the many mulit-activity weekends to the likes of
                        Snowdonia/Devon/Peak District etc and so combine climbing with whatever else is going on.
                        It's a nice relaxed club with the opportunity to do other stuff alongside climbing too. The 8th
                        Day really is one of the best multi-sport clubs in London and we can't speak more highly of them
                        (it might be due to the fact that one of the London Climbing Guide crew has actually been a
                        member of the 8th Day!).</p>

                    <h3> The Alpine Club </h3>
                    <p> The Alpine Club, is the world's first mountaineering club, has members from around the world. It
                        was founded in 1857 and since then they have been at the leading edge of worldwide

                        but we would recommend you join one of the other clubs listed here to gain experience. </p>
                    <p>The Alpine Club promotes a code of climbing ethics, which seeks to protect mountains, mountain
                        regions and their people from any harmful impact by climbers. The club is globally recognized as
                        influential on these issues. Membership to the Alpine club entry really is one of the
                        aspirations of any climber/mountaineer.</p>
